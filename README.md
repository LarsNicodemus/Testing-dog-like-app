# Testing Dog-Like App

This project is a playful and interactive app developed as part of the iOS module at the Syntax Institute. It is a solo project designed to teach and practice **gestures**, **micro-interactions**, and **testing** in iOS development. The app simulates a virtual dog that responds to user interactions, providing a fun way to explore gesture recognition, animations, and robust testing practices.

## About the App

The Testing Dog-Like App is a demonstration of how to implement engaging user interactions and animations in an iOS app. Users can interact with a virtual dog using gestures like taps, swipes, and long presses, triggering micro-interactions such as animations or sound effects. The project also emphasizes the importance of writing unit tests and UI tests to ensure app reliability.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Interact with the virtual dog using taps, swipes, long presses, and other gestures.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Enjoy animations and sound effects triggered by user interactions.
- **Virtual Pet Simulation**: A fun and engaging way to explore gesture-based interactions.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests and UI tests to ensure the app functions as expected.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **Gestures**: Implement tap, swipe, long press, and other gestures using SwiftUI.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Add small, engaging animations and feedback to enhance user experience.
- **Unit Testing**: Write tests for individual components and logic.
- **UI Testing**: Automate testing of the user interface to ensure functionality and usability.
- **SwiftUI**: Build the user interface using Swift's declarative framework.
